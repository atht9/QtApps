# QtApps

These are some examples of applications I developed for my class and colleagues in C++ using the Qt 5 framework.  

You must run the .pro file using Qt Creator.

For any help in opening or using them, feel free to contact me. 

**Note** that these are mostly just to get accustomed with the GUI and the syntax, they were made hastily and still need some optimisation, but they should be good for someone wanting to learn the basics.   

# PREDICTOR V1

An application for predicting the results for the return fixtures of the 2019-2020 season of the Premier League, Serie A, Ligue 1, La Liga and Bundesliga, **using a model based on Poisson distribution**. This one needs a database, you can contact me if you want it, and I'll give you further instructions to link it if you need so.

# Integralles Numeriques

# Serie Statistique
